# Google-Hosted jQuery
Use the Google CDN version of jQuery in WordPress, with a local fallback. Forked from [Travis Smith's script on GitHub](https://gist.github.com/wpsmith/4083811).


## How It Works
Getting started with Google-Hosted jQuery is as simple as installing a plugin:

1. Upload the `google-hosted-jquery` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress.
3. Pat yourself on the back.

Seriously, you're done. Nice work! jQuery 1.9.1 is the version used by default, but you change the version number under "Settings" in the Admin Dashboard.
