Use the Google CDN version of jQuery in WordPress, with a local fallback if it's unavailable.

Google-Hosted jQuery is a plugin that uses the Google-hosted version of jQuery for better site performance. It includes a local fallback in case Google's CDN is unavailable. Forked from [Travis Smith's script on GitHub](https://gist.github.com/wpsmith/4083811).

## Getting Started

Getting started with Google-Hosted jQuery is as simple as installing a plugin:

1. Upload the `google-hosted-jquery` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress.

And that's it, you're done. Nice work! jQuery 1.9.1 is the version used by default, but you change the version number under "Settings" in the Admin Dashboard.



## How to Contribute

In lieu of a formal style guide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Don't forget to update the version number, the changelog (in the `readme.md` file), and when applicable, the documentation.
